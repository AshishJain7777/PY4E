greet = "hello bob"
nstr = greet.replace("bob","jane") # replace is used to replace so value with another value. As per this example in bracket bob is the existing and the jane is to get replaced to pre existing. This example shoes that we can make change in a word. Not another string would be disturb.
print(nstr)


nstr = greet.replace("o","x") # same here o is the pre existing and x is going to replace the o. In this example it is shown that we can also work on a single alphabet.
print(nstr)
