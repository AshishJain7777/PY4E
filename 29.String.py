str1 = "hello" # this is our first variable for a string value
str2 = "there" # this our second variable
bob = str1 + str2 # in this we tried to add to string and try to make them together or add which is possible in python.
print(bob) # so the answer would be str1 + str2 or hello + there = hellothere.

str3 = "123"  # but in this case python wont consider it as a numerical it is an string and in the next line we tried to make python to add these value, which is not going to happen because first value is string and anothero one is numerical
# str3 = str3 + 1

x = int(str3) + 1  # so in this we converted string to an int variable and now we can add any number we want because it is ready for equational computation.
print(x)
