# ".lower()" is used to turn the whole string to lowercase . In example if I gave a variable string "ASHISH" if before printing I assign some other variable this string and put .lower() beside it , the whole string will turn into a lowercase charachter.
print(greet)
print("hi there".lower())
# This is a built in function, It does not alter original value of a variable.
