# the string or banana written above have its own identity which is shown just below that word.
fruit = "banana"
letter = fruit[1]  # in this line we try to know the identity of that number by recalling that number into variable "letter". [1] this indicate the poistion of the string.

x = 3  # here we assigned a new variable named x which is consist of value 3
w = fruit [x-1] # here we are storing the equation ( from string of fruit we asked answer of 3-1 which is 2 so the question we are asking and assigning to w is what is the value is in string which is holding position 2. Hopefully the answer would be n )
print(w)

zot = "abc"
print(zot[2]) # this is the right form to recall.

print(zot[5]) # but this is going to throw an error, because the place 5th isn't assigned or even it doesn't exist.
