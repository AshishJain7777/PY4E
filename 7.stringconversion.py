sval = "123"
# print(sval + 1)


# the example we same above is not going to run because we store 123 as an string, and we tried to add a value which is 1, so according to this a string cannot be added with an integer value.

ival = int(sval)
print(ival + 1)
#the example given above will run because the value we put in the string was numericals, so the after using the method of conversion we converted the numericals or "string" to an integer variable and after that we added that. so, the result is 124 now.

nsv = "hello bob"
niv = int(nsv)
# the example given above is not going to work, as we learn that a we can change the string to integer but there is a rule behind that , the string must contains the values in numericals.
